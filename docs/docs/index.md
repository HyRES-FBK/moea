# Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) documentation

The MOEA package provides a suite of multi-objective algorithms and models for
energy planning. A few case studies are reproduced from the literature and
provided as example cases.

## Contents

- See the [Installation](installation.md) page to initialize the Python
environment.
- For the impatients, the [Get started](getting-started.md) page showcase how
to run the algorithm with a set of built-in cases.
- The [Documentation](documentation.md) page provides a complete guide of the
available models and algorithms.
- The MOEA package is thought as a command line application. You can read about
how to use the commands in the [Usage](usage.md) page.
- A collection of [Use cases](use-cases.md) help to get familiar with the use
of the MOEA.
