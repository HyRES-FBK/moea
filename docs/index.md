# MOEA for energy scenario optimization

The MOEA package provides a suite of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms
for energy scenario optimization.
Energy scenario are modeled using Python classes as they were multi-objective
optimization problems.
A few case studies are reproduced from the literature and
provided as example cases.

## Reading guide

- The [Get started](contents/getting-started.md) page shows how to initialize
the Python environment and run the algorithm on a set of built-in cases.
- An in-depth guide to the declaration of models and the use of the optimizer
is provided in the [Usage section](contents/usage.md).
- The [Documentation](contents/documentation.md) page provides a complete guide
of the available models and algorithms.
- A collection of reference cases help to get familiar with the use of the
optimization suite.
