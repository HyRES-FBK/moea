abstract = {Environmental and security concerns urge energy planners to design more sustainable energy systems, reducing fossil fuel consumptions in favour of renewable solutions. The proposed scenarios typically rely on a mixing of different energy sources, thereby mitigating the availability and intermittency problems typically related to renewable technologies. Optimizing this combination is of crucial importance to cope with economic, technical, and environmental issues, which typically give rise to multiple contradictory objectives. To this purpose, this article presents a generalized framework coupling EnergyPLAN – a descriptive analytical model for medium/large-scale energy systems – with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm – a type of optimizer widely used in the context of complex problems. By using this framework, it is possible to automatically identify a set of Pareto-optimal configurations with respect to different competing objectives. As an example, the method is applied to the case of Aalborg municipality, Denmark, by choosing cost and carbon emission minimization as contrasting goals. Results are compared with a manually identified scenario, taken from previous literature. The automatic approach, while confirming that the available manual solution is very close to optimality, yields an entire set of additional optimal solutions, showing its effectiveness in the simultaneous analysis of a wide range of combinations.}

abstract="In this paper, we present a parallel version of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that incorporates some coevolutionary concepts. Such an algorithm was previosly developed by the authors. Two approaches were adopted to parallelize our algorithm (both of them based on a master-slave scheme): one uses Pthreads (shared memory) and the other one uses MPI (distributed memory). We conduct a small comparative study to analyze the impact that the parallelization has on performance. Our results indicate that both parallel versions produce important improvements in the execution times of the algorithm (with respect to the serial version) while keeping the quality of the results obtained.",

abstract = {The design of future local energy scenarios, under the framework of covenant of mayors' initiative, is an important and challenging task for the energy and policy planners. Designing energy scenarios is a multi-objective optimization problem, hence, a framework that combines a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and EnergyPLAN is employed to identify optimized scenarios. In this study, optimized scenarios for the policy makers of Giudicarie Esteriori are identified, so that they are able to face the challenges of minimizing energy costs and CO2 emissions, decreasing the dependency on foreign resources, and integrating large amount of renewable energy. The results show that economically attractive, environmental friendly and less dependent energy scenarios can be achieved by 1) increasing the capacity of photovoltaics, 2) maximizing local biomass usage through individual wood boilers, and 3) partially electrifying the thermal sector through ground source heat pumps. The modification of the transport sector by introducing electric cars is not economically viable under the current market conditions. Our kind of study can be performed for the policy makers of other regions as well, by 1) collecting energy data, 2) identifying local renewable resources, 3) modelling reference scenarios, 4) identifying optimized scenarios, 5) studying the scenarios according to the requirements.}
