# Multi-objective optimization algorithms

In this package, multi-objective optimization algorithms are stored as modules.
The module name is passed as input to the CLI app to run it.

```bash
moea <module_name_of_the_algorithm> <model_name>
```

When declaring a new algorithm, inherits from the class ``BasicAlgorithm`` in
the module ``basic_algorithm.py``.
