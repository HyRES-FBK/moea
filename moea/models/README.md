# Model definition

In PyMOO, an optimization problem is defined by subclassing one of the
available problem classes, see
[the official documentation](https://pymoo.org/problems/definition.html) for
more about this.

The ``ElementwiseProblem`` class is the simplest to understand for the purpose
of this project, again, see
[the official documentation](https://pymoo.org/problems/definition.html#ElementwiseProblem-(loop))
for more about this.
